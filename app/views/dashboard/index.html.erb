      <div class="mx-3">
        I have a Shiba Inu, Somi
        (<%=link_to "instagram", "https://www.instagram.com/somishiba16", target: "_blank", class: "text-blue-500 underline" %>)
        , who I love very much, and spend most of my time outside of work reading, working out 💪, or taking care of her 🐕.
        I spend an absurd amount of money on Boba, and I cannot function without a Starbucks Americano or Cold Brew in the morning.
